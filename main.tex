% === I. INTRODUCTION =============================================================
\section{Introduction}
Hydroponics is a modern soilless cultivation technique that enables crops to grow in nutrient-rich water solutions rather than traditional soil media \cite{ullah2019iot}. This innovative method has gained significant attention worldwide due to its ability to maximize crop yield, reduce water and nutrient consumption, and allow year-round production irrespective of climate or geographical constraints \cite{septafiansyah2024ai,srivastav2023iot}. Compared to conventional soil-based farming, hydroponics minimizes land usage and reduces the risk of soil-borne diseases, making it an attractive alternative for urban and resource-constrained environments. However, the success of hydroponic farming depends heavily on the precise regulation of multiple environmental factors, including water level, pH value, nutrient concentration, temperature, humidity, and lighting \cite{shedek2023smart}. Maintaining these parameters manually is highly labor-intensive and prone to errors. Fluctuations in pH or nutrient concentration can significantly affect plant growth and lead to crop loss. Similarly, improper temperature and humidity levels can create unfavorable conditions for optimal photosynthesis and transpiration, while incorrect light exposure can negatively impact plant metabolism \cite{iieta2024automated}. Consequently, there is a pressing need for automated, real-time monitoring and control systems that ensure stable growing conditions in hydroponic farms.
\newparagraph
The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a powerful enabler for automating agricultural processes. IoT allows the integration of sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers with cloud-based data processing to create intelligent, real-time decision-making systems \cite{ieee2022hydroponics,fan2022iot}. In hydroponics, IoT facilitates continuous monitoring of environmental parameters, timely control of nutrient solutions, water circulation, climate regulation, and light management. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of IoT to enhance resource efficiency and reduce human intervention, although many existing systems focus on either monitoring or isolated control of a single parameter \cite{ullah2019iot,srivastav2023iot,shedek2023smart}. The ESP32 microcontroller has become a popular choice for IoT-based hydroponic systems due to its low cost, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, and compatibility with a wide range of sensors and actuators \cite{shedek2023smart,wang2023esp32}. Its ability to handle multiple inputs and outputs makes it suitable for multi-parameter control, including pH balancing, water pumping, temperature-humidity regulation, and light automation. Recent implementations using ESP32 have shown that real-time sensor data can be leveraged to automate nutrient delivery, fan and pump activation, and lighting schedules, resulting in consistent and optimized plant growth \cite{shedek2023smart,srivastav2023iot}.Despite these advancements, several limitations remain in the current literature. Many systems rely on expensive proprietary hardware, lack multi-parameter integration, or require manual intervention for certain critical processes. Moreover, real-time actuation mechanisms that simultaneously control pH, water level, and climate parameters are rarely implemented in low-cost frameworks suitable for small-scale farms \cite{lee2023smart,kumar2022automated}. This highlights a gap for a cost-effective, fully automated hydroponics system capable of real-time environmental management.
\newparagraph
To address these challenges, this research proposes an IoT-based automated hydroponics monitoring and control system using ESP32. The system integrates pH sensors, water level sensors, DHT11 temperature-humidity sensors, and automated pumps, fans, and lighting units. It employs intelligent control algorithms to maintain optimal conditions: pH levels are balanced automatically, water levels are regulated when low, temperature and humidity are controlled via fans, and lighting schedules are optimized to simulate natural daylight cycles. The framework is energy-efficient, scalable, and requires minimal human supervision, making it suitable for both small-scale and commercial hydroponic setups.

The main contributions of this research are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and implementation of an integrated ESP32-based hydroponics monitoring system incorporating multiple environmental parameters, including pH, water level, temperature, humidity, and light \cite{ullah2019iot,srivastav2023iot}.
    \item Development of automated control algorithms for real-time pH balancing, water pumping, climate regulation, and lighting management \cite{shedek2023smart,lee2023smart}.
    \item Demonstration of real-time monitoring and data acquisition to ensure stable growing conditions and optimized plant growth with minimal manual intervention \cite{wang2023esp32,kumar2022automated}.
    \item Provision of a low-cost, scalable, and energy-efficient framework suitable for smart farming applications in urban and resource-limited environments \cite{iieta2024automated,ieee2022hydroponics}.
\end{enumerate}

% === II. RELATED WORK ============================================================
\section{Related Work}
Hydroponics has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for efficient and sustainable crop production. Several studies have explored the integration of IoT technologies in hydroponic systems to automate monitoring and control processes. \citet{ullah2019iot} proposed an IoT-based monitoring framework for hydroponic farms, focusing on real-time measurement of pH, temperature, and water level. Their system demonstrated improved resource efficiency and reduced manual intervention but lacked advanced control algorithms for automated nutrient management.
\newparagraph
Similarly, \citet{srivastav2023iot} developed an ESP32-based hydroponics system that enabled remote monitoring and basic actuation of pumps and fans. While effective in maintaining environmental parameters, the system did not incorporate multi-parameter integration or predictive control mechanisms. \citet{shedek2023smart} introduced a smart farming approach leveraging IoT sensors to regulate temperature, humidity, and lighting, achieving enhanced plant growth performance. However, their framework relied on proprietary hardware, limiting scalability and accessibility for small-scale farmers. \citet{lee2023smart} implemented a low-cost hydroponic control system capable of simultaneous regulation of pH, water level, and light exposure using feedback-based control loops. \citet{iieta2024automated} designed a scalable hydroponics platform using ESP32 and Wi-Fi modules for remote monitoring, demonstrating energy-efficient operation and real-time alerts for abnormal environmental conditions. \citet{wang2023esp32} focused on real-time nutrient management and automated pump activation, highlighting ESP32’s ability to handle multiple sensor inputs simultaneously. Several studies have explored the use of predictive models and AI-based optimization for hydroponics. \citet{kumar2022automated} used machine learning algorithms to predict nutrient requirements and adjust pH levels accordingly. \citet{fan2022iot} integrated cloud-based analytics with IoT sensors to optimize water usage and environmental control. \citet{ieee2022hydroponics} proposed a blockchain-enabled IoT system for transparent monitoring and data integrity in hydroponic farming.
\newparagraph
Additional research has investigated environmental and energy efficiency aspects. \citet{zhou2021smart} focused on energy-aware lighting and climate regulation, reducing overall electricity consumption. \citet{singh2022iot} implemented a multi-sensor network for automated detection of water deficiencies and microclimate fluctuations. \citet{patel2021hydroponics} studied modular hydroponic units with IoT integration for urban agriculture applications, providing scalable and compact solutions. Despite these efforts, existing research often targets either monitoring or isolated control of individual parameters rather than comprehensive, multi-parameter automation. Many systems require manual calibration or rely on expensive hardware, restricting broader adoption. This highlights the necessity for a fully integrated, cost-effective IoT-based hydroponics system capable of real-time, autonomous control of pH, water levels, climate, and lighting conditions, providing both small-scale and commercial farmers with reliable and efficient smart farming solutions \cite{ullah2019iot,srivastav2023iot,shedek2023smart,lee2023smart,iieta2024automated,wang2023esp32,kumar2022automated,fan2022iot,ieee2022hydroponics,zhou2021smart,singh2022iot,patel2021hydroponics}.

% === III. METHODOLOGY ============================================================

\section{Methodology}
This section describes the design, hardware components, sensor integration, and control algorithms used in the proposed IoT-based automated hydroponics system. The methodology emphasizes real-time monitoring, multi-parameter environmental control, and energy-efficient operation using the ESP32 microcontroller.

\subsection{System Architecture}
The proposed hydroponics system consists of four main components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sensing Layer:} This layer includes multiple sensors to monitor critical environmental parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item pH sensor for nutrient solution acidity measurement.
        \item Water level sensor (float sensor) for monitoring tank water levels.
        \item DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity measurement.
        \item Optional light sensors for ambient light monitoring.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Control Layer:} The ESP32 microcontroller acts as the central processing unit. It reads sensor data, applies control algorithms, and actuates pumps, fans, and lighting systems. ESP32’s integrated Wi-Fi enables remote monitoring and cloud-based data logging.
    
    \item \textbf{Actuation Layer:} This layer includes relays and actuators to control:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Water pumps for circulating and replenishing nutrient solutions.
        \item Fans for temperature and humidity control.
        \item LED grow lights for simulating daylight cycles.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User Interface and Cloud Layer:} Sensor data and system status are transmitted to a cloud platform or mobile interface for visualization and remote control. Alerts are generated in case of abnormal conditions (e.g., low water level, pH imbalance, or high temperature).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sensor Data Acquisition}
Sensors continuously collect environmental parameters at fixed intervals. The ESP32 reads analog or digital signals, converts them to meaningful values (e.g., pH units, Celsius for temperature, percentage for humidity), and stores them temporarily for control decisions. Filtering techniques such as moving average or median filters are applied to remove noise and ensure stable measurements.

\subsection{Control Algorithms}
The control logic follows a feedback-based approach to maintain optimal growing conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{pH Control:} If the pH value falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 6.0), a dedicated pump adds alkaline solution until the pH reaches the optimal range (6.5–7.0). Sensor readings are re-checked every few seconds to avoid overshooting.
    
    \item \textbf{Water Level Regulation:} The float sensor detects low water levels. When triggered, the main water pump is activated to refill the nutrient tank until the water level reaches the normal range.
    
    \item \textbf{Temperature and Humidity Control:} The DHT11 sensor provides real-time temperature and humidity readings. Fans are automatically turned ON if the temperature exceeds the upper threshold (e.g., 27°C) or humidity falls outside the desired range, and turned OFF when conditions normalize.
    
    \item \textbf{Lighting Control:} LED grow lights follow a scheduled operation to simulate natural daylight cycles. The ESP32 can adjust light intensity or duration based on time of day or external light sensor input.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System Integration and Automation}
All sensor readings and actuation commands are coordinated by the ESP32, which ensures synchronized operation of pumps, fans, and lights. The system supports real-time decision-making and can function autonomously without human intervention. Cloud connectivity allows remote monitoring, logging, and optional manual overrides via a mobile app or web dashboard.

\subsection{Flow Diagram of the System}
The overall system workflow can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sensors measure pH, water level, temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
    \item ESP32 reads the sensor values and compares them to predefined thresholds.
    \item Based on the control algorithm:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Activate water pumps for pH balancing or water refill.
        \item Switch fans ON/OFF to regulate temperature and humidity.
        \item Control LED lights according to schedule.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Data is logged to the cloud and alerts are generated if abnormal conditions persist.
    \item The system repeats the monitoring and control loop continuously.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments and Results}
To evaluate the performance of the proposed IoT-based hydroponics system, a series of experiments were conducted in a controlled indoor setup. The experimental setup consisted of a 20-liter nutrient tank, ESP32 microcontroller, pH sensor, water level float sensor, DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor, LED grow lights, water pump, and cooling fans. Data were collected over a period of 7 days to test real-time monitoring, control accuracy, and system stability.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
The system was configured with the following thresholds and parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{pH range:} 6.5--7.0, with automatic correction using an alkaline pump.
    \item \textbf{Water level:} Refill triggered when tank level drops below 25\%.
    \item \textbf{Temperature:} Upper threshold 27°C, lower threshold 20°C.
    \item \textbf{Humidity:} Maintain 50--70\% relative humidity.
    \item \textbf{Lighting:} 16 hours ON / 8 hours OFF cycle.
\end{itemize}

Sensor readings were logged every 5 seconds, and actuator responses were automatically triggered based on feedback.

\subsection{pH Monitoring and Control}

Figure~\ref{fig:phresults} shows the pH variation over a 24-hour period. The system successfully detected drops in pH due to nutrient uptake and activated the pH pump to maintain the optimal range. The maximum overshoot observed was 0.1 pH units, demonstrating precise control.
